<td valign="top">

### Deployment Intelligence

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/fresh_deploy-smart_detection-47A248?style=flat-square&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white" alt="Fresh Deploy"/>
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/redeployment-IP_tracking-2496ED?style=flat-square&logo=docker&logoColor=white" alt="Redeployment"/>

- **Intelligent Fresh Deployment**: Configures and initiates a replica set from scratch with smart node detection, accounting for `down` or `unavailable` swarm nodes and deployment constraints.
- **Smart Redeployment Detection**: Automatically detects container redeployments with changed IP addresses and immediately updates configuration without unnecessary delays or false initialization attempts.
- **Optimized Performance**: Fast reconfiguration during full redeployments with intelligent primary detection using current task IPs instead of stale configuration data.
- **Advanced Startup Handling**: Robust retry logic handles MongoDB transitional states (`NotYetInitialized`) during startup, distinguishing between temporary states and actual fresh deployments.

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/logging-ANSI_color-555?style=flat-square" alt="Logging"/>

- **Primary Node Management**: Automatic primary designation, tracking, and failover handling with intelligent election timeout and forced reconfiguration when needed.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Real-time addition and removal of MongoDB nodes during runtime with automatic replica set reconfiguration and member management.
- **Comprehensive User Setup**: Automated creation of MongoDB admin (root) accounts and initial application database users with proper authentication and permissions.
- **Continuous Topology Monitoring**: Watches Docker Swarm changes and adjusts replica set configuration for IP changes, node additions/removals, and network topology updates.
- **Production-Ready Logging**: Color-coded ANSI logging with contextual messages, eliminating misleading errors during normal operations.
- **Enterprise Scalability**: Designed for multi-node Docker Swarm environments, tested against various outage scenarios and edge cases for maximum reliability.

## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| **MongoDB** | 8.0.x (recipe uses `8.0.13`; 7.0 compatible) |
| **PyMongo Driver** | 4.15.x — pinned `>=4.15,<5`, included in controller image |
| **Docker** | >= `24.0.5` |
| **OS** | Linux >= Ubuntu 23.04 (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm/v7`, `linux/arm64`) |

<br>

## Prerequisites

- A [Docker Swarm cluster](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/) (local or cloud) — tested on 6-node Swarm
- Docker Stack recipe — see [`docker-compose-stack.yml`](./docker-compose-stack.yml)
- Environment variables — see [`mongo-rs.env`](./mongo-rs.env)
- Deployment script — [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh)

<br>

---

## How to Use

1. Set all required environment variables in [`mongo-rs.env`](./mongo-rs.env) (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below).

2. Modify `docker-compose-stack.yml` to include your application service. Set your app's MongoDB URI to:

    ```
    mongodb://${MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME}:${MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD}@database:27017/?replicaSet=${REPLICASET_NAME}
    ```

3. Deploy via [`./deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh) — this will:
    - Import environment variables
    - Create a `backend` overlay network with encryption enabled
    - Generate a `keyfile` for the replica set and add it as a Docker secret
    - Spin up all stack services: `mongo`, `dbcontroller`, `nosqlclient`, and your application
    - Run `dbcontroller` in **global** mode (one instance per Swarm node)

4. Monitor logs for output and errors (see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting--additional-details)).

5. To remove the stack:

    ```bash
    ./remove.sh
    # or
    docker stack rm [stackname]
    ```

    > The `_backend` overlay network is not removed automatically (it is external). Leave it in place when redeploying to retain the original subnet and avoid connectivity issues.

<br>

## Environment Variables

Defined in [`mongo-rs.env`](./mongo-rs.env):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `STACK_NAME` | `myapp` | Docker stack name |
| `MONGO_VERSION` | `8.0.13` | MongoDB image tag |
| `REPLICASET_NAME` | `rs` | Replica set name |
| `BACKEND_NETWORK_NAME` | `${STACK_NAME}_backend` | Overlay network name |
| `MONGO_SERVICE_URI` | `${STACK_NAME}_database` | MongoDB service name |
| `MONGO_ROOT_USERNAME` | `root` | Admin username |
| `MONGO_ROOT_PASSWORD` | `password123` | Admin password |
| `INITDB_DATABASE` | `myinitdatabase` | Initial database name |
| `INITDB_USER` | `mydbuser` | Initial database user |
| `INITDB_PASSWORD` | `password` | Initial database password |

<br>

## How It Works

- **Smart Discovery**: Identifies and assesses MongoDB services in the Docker Swarm with intelligent node state detection and constraint handling.
- **Deployment Intelligence**: Distinguishes between fresh deployments, redeployments with IP changes, and dynamic scaling scenarios using advanced configuration analysis.
- **Optimized Configuration**: Uses current task IPs for primary detection during redeployments, eliminating delays from stale configuration data.
- **Adaptive Management**: Handles MongoDB startup transitional states with retry logic, ensuring reliable operation across various deployment scenarios.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously adapts replica set configuration for network changes, node lifecycle events, and topology updates with minimal downtime.

The [nosqlclient](https://www.nosqlclient.com/) service included in the recipe provides a web UI at `http://<any-swarm-node-ip>:3030` for browsing and managing the database.

The compose YML pulls the latest controller from DockerHub via [jackietreehorn/mongo-replica-ctrl](https://hub.docker.com/r/jackietreehorn/mongo-replica-ctrl). You can also pull it manually (`docker pull jackietreehorn/mongo-replica-ctrl:latest`) or build locally using the included [`./build.sh`](./build.sh).

<br>

## Troubleshooting / Additional Details

### Logs

Check Docker service logs for the `dbcontroller` service. Enable `DEBUG:1` in the compose YML for verbose output. The controller uses **colored ANSI logging**:

| Color | Level |
|-------|-------|
| GREEN | INFO messages |
| YELLOW | WARNING messages and IP addresses |
| RED | ERROR messages |
| MAGENTA (bold) | PRIMARY nodes |
| CYAN | SECONDARY nodes and DEBUG messages |
| BOLD | ReplicaSet-related terms |

```bash
docker service logs [servicename]_dbcontroller --follow
```

Example output:

![Controller log output: member changes, config updates, primary election](./screenshots/replicaset-manager-log-1.png)
![Controller log output: redeployment, config detection, primary failover](./screenshots/replicaset-manager-log-2.png)

<br>

### Common Issues

**Environment** — verify all variables are correctly set in [`mongo-rs.env`](./mongo-rs.env).

**Docker Stack Compose YML** — `dbcontroller` must run as a single instance on a Swarm manager node. Multiple instances will perform conflicting actions. A restart policy is included in the service definition for error recovery.

> **IMPORTANT**: The default MongoDB port `27017` is used internally only and is **not** published outside the Swarm by design. Publishing this port will break replica set management.

**Firewalls / SELinux** — Linux distributions using [SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux) are known to cause [issues with MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-red-hat/). Check with `sestatus` and either disable or [configure it for MongoDB](https://severalnines.com/blog/how-configure-selinux-mongodb-replica-sets/). Also verify your firewall allows MongoDB traffic.

**Networking** — the `_backend` overlay network is assigned an address space automatically by Docker. To define a custom network space, uncomment the relevant section in [`deploy.sh`](./deploy.sh). Do **not** remove this network between redeployments.

**Persistent Data** — the `mongo` service must run in [**global mode**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/deploy/#mode) to prevent multiple instances sharing the same data directory. Volumes are defined as external to prevent accidental deletion between redeployments.

**Swarm Nodes** — for HA, run more than one Swarm manager so `dbcontroller` can restart on a different node if needed.

**Healthchecks** — the [mongo-healthcheck](./mongo-healthcheck) script only verifies MongoDB process health (not cluster status). Cluster status is managed by `dbcontroller`. The script is POSIX `sh` compatible and uses `mongosh ping`.

**MongoDB Configuration Check** — run [`./docker-mongodb_config-check.sh`](./docker-mongodb_config-check.sh) from any manager node to fetch `rs.status()` and `rs.config()` output:

```bash
./docker-mongodb_config-check.sh
```

```
members: [
    {
    _id: 1,
    name: '10.0.26.51:27017',
    health: 1,
    state: 2,
    stateStr: 'SECONDARY',
    ...
    },
    {
    _id: 2,
    name: '10.0.26.48:27017',
    health: 1,
    state: 1,
    stateStr: 'PRIMARY',     <--- should match dbcontroller log output
    ...
    }
```

**Service Start-up** — on initial deployment, image downloads and replica set initialization take time. Dependent services (e.g. `nosqlclient`, your application) may fail and restart until MongoDB is ready — this is expected behavior. MongoDB in replica set mode is not available until a primary is elected.
